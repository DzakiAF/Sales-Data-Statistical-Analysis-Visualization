📊 E-Commerce Product Sales Analysis with Statistical Inference
📁 Project Overview
This project performs an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Statistical Inference on a product sales dataset. It focuses on identifying product trends, analyzing customer return behavior, testing data normality, and applying statistical hypothesis testing.

This analysis is part of a data science learning milestone and demonstrates both technical and analytical thinking using Python.

🧰 Tools and Libraries Used
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scipy.stats

Statsmodels

🔍 Key Analyses
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Top 5 Products Sold

Sales Distribution by Product Category

Most Returned Products by Category

Monthly Sales Trend

2. Statistical Summary
Skewness & Kurtosis: Understanding data distribution

Uji Normalitas (Normality Test): Shapiro-Wilk & D’Agostino K-squared

Visual Checks: Histogram, Q-Q Plot

3. Inferential Statistics
Hypothesis Testing:

Two-sample Independent T-Test

Mann-Whitney U Test (as non-parametric alternative)

Goal: To assess if there is a significant difference in product prices between two groups (e.g., Jabodetabek vs. non-Jabodetabek)

📌 Insights
Certain categories have higher return rates — potential product quality or customer expectation issues.

The price distribution is right-skewed with notable outliers.

Not all groups follow a normal distribution → careful selection of hypothesis test is needed.

Statistical tests reveal significant differences in certain product prices based on regional segmentation.

🧠 Learning Points
Real-world data often requires detailed cleaning before statistical analysis.

Visual inspection + formal tests are crucial to validate assumptions like normality.

Proper selection of hypothesis tests enhances the validity of conclusions.
